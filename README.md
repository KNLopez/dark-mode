# Dark Mode Coding Challenge

&nbsp;

# Goals / Outcomes ‚ú®

-   Use state and global state and manipulate DOM to achieve a dark mode on the view

&nbsp;

# Pre-requisites ‚úÖ

None

&nbsp;

# Requirements üìñ

-   There is an existing dark mode button provided. Add functionality to switch to dark mode when it is clicked
-   Use the existing dark mode scss file and add that to the root `html` element as a class
-   As an alternative you can use theming from styled components
-   Add dark-mode switching functionality to the _existing_ dark-mode button
-   Once in Dark mode:
    -   The button icon should be `faSun`
    -   The button icon colour should be `(#00BDE4)`. You can use the `color` prop on the `Icon` component.

# Things to consider üí°

-   How we would use Dark mode on other potential routes/components in a bigger application. Would your solution work for this?
-   How we can apply a class to the `html` DOM element

# What's Already Been Done üèÅ

-   Basic app UI (mobile responsive)
-   Dark mode and light mode styles/themes
